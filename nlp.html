        <h3> What is Natural Language Processing? </h3>
        <p>
            Natural Language Processing, or NPL for short, is the automatic manipulation of natural language such as
            speech and text by software (Brownlee 2017, para. 1). It concerns the interaction between computers and
            human language in particular and how they process and analyze natural language data, including speech and
            text, alongside human peculiarities such as homonyms, homophones, sarcasm, idioms, metaphors, grammar,
            syntaxes (IBM Cloud Education 2020, para. 4) and in case of the Vietnamese language, diacritics.
            <br>
            Using computational linguistics - rule-based modelling of human language - with statistical, machine
            learning and deep learning models, enables computers to process written text and voice data, with the end
            goals of mastering speech recognition, natural language understanding and generation. Other, more
            sophisticated tasks include:

            <li>
                <b>Content categorization: </b> A linguistic-based document summary, including search and indexing,
                content alerts and duplication detection.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Topic discovery and modelling: </b> Accurately capture the meaning and themes in text collections,
                and
                apply advanced analytics to text, like optimization and forecasting.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Contextual extraction: </b> Automatically pull structured information from text-based sources.

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Sentiment analysis:</b> Identifying the mood or subjective opinions within large amounts of text,
                including average sentiment and opinion mining.

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversion:</b> Transforming voice commands into written text, and
                vice versa.

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Document summarization:</b> Automatically generating synopses of large bodies of text.

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Machine translation:</b>Automatic translation of text or speech from one language to another

            </li>
            <br>
            Examples of NLP in everyday life include digital assistants (Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri, etc.), voice
            typing, grammar checking softwares (Grammarly, Microsoft Editor, etc.), or spam detection where NLOP’s text
            classification capabilities are used to scan emails for words or phrases that often indicate spam or
            phishing e.g. overuse of financial terms, characteristic bad grammar, threatening language, inappropriate
            urgency, misspelt company names (IBM Cloud Education 2020, para. 19).
            <br>
            There are two subsets within NLP, namely Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language
            Generation (NLG). As stated by Kavlakoglu (2020), NLU uses syntactic and semantic analysis of text and
            speech to determine the meaning of a sentence, whilst NLG focuses on enabling computers to write, or
            generate, texts. There are three stages each NLG application must go through in order to form an appropriate
            response to a given data input:
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Text planning:</b>During the first stage, general content is formulated and ordered in a logical
                manner.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Sentence planning:</b>The second stage takes into account punctuation and text flow, breaking the
                above content into chunks (paragraphs and sentences) and utilising pronouns or conjunctions where
                applicable.

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Realization:</b>In the final stage, grammatical accuracy is scrutinized to ensure that punctuations
                and conjugations are correctly used.
            </li>

        </p>

        <h3>What is the likely impact? </h3>
        <p>
            Perhaps businesses would be the one reaping the most benefits from NLP as the technology evolves. Roe (2021,
            para. 6) reported that customer service is the top use case for NLP within the context of COVID-19, with 52
            percent of global IT professionals confirming that their company was using or considering using NLP to
            improve customer experience..


            <br>
            Another area where NLP shines is in digital marketing, where companies could leverage its sentiment analysis
            capabilities on social media. By analyzing language used in social media posts, responses, reviews, and more
            to extract attitudes and emotions in response to products, promotions, and events, marketers can uncover
            hidden insights from their followers/consumers/customers to use in product designs, marketing campaigns, or
            to address any public relation crisis before it escalates.

            <br>
            One final example of NLP implementation is chatbots - a computer program that utilizes artificial
            intelligence (AI) and NLP to understand customer questions and automate response to them, creating a feeling
            of a normal human conversation. Where digital assistants respond to voice commands, chatbots do the same for
            typed text entries. Over time, they also learn to recognize contextual clues about the customer request,
            little nuances that will enable them to come up with better answers and suggestions in the future.

            <br>
            National Geographic is a chatbots success story, with their “Genius” bot, designed to promote the channel’s
            TV show with the same name, managed to generate extensive discussion and engagement - average 6-8 minute
            conversing, 11 turns per conversation, 50% user re-engagement (Siu 2020, para. 28) on their Facebook page.

            <br>
            Human Resources will also benefit from NLP. Within the recruitment process, NLP saves precious time by
            scanning through inbound resumes, looking for keywords, and screening candidates. Furthermore, NLP-enhanced
            automated interviews allow hiring managers to better assess candidates through their word usage, speech
            patterns, facial expressions, and so on.

        <h3>How will this affect you? </h3>
        <p>
            There have been numerous advancements in NLP technologie within the consumer space. One such pioneer is
            Google. In 2018, the company introduced Google Duplex, duped as “a new technology for conducting natural
            conversations to carry out “real world” tasks over the phone” (Leviathan & Matias 2018, para. 2). The
            authors pointed out at the time that Duplex would streamline specific tasks such as scheduling appointments,
            where the system’s NLP enabled Duplex to understand complex sentences, contexts, intents, and pacing within
            a conversation. Google demoed Duplex’s capabilities during its I/O event in 2018 (See below).

            <br>
        <div class="video">
            <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D5VN56jQMWM"></iframe>
            <p> Google Duplex: A.I. Assistant Calls Local Businesses To Make Appointments </p>
        </div>
        </p>
        In the context of booking a table of a restaurant, this means users can simply interact with the Google
        Assistant, and the call happens completely in the background without his/her involvement.

        <br>
        Another instance where Google demonstrated its NLP expertise was its Direct My Call feature recently introduced
        with the Pixel 6 line of phones. This feature lets those who are calling businesses such as banks or restaurants
        to be able to see a live transcribe of the call in real time, and Google Assistant also displays button prompts
        for the users to choose when asked to input credit card number for example.

        <br>
        According to Jędrzejowicz (2021, para. 3) Direct My Call, powered by Google’s Duplex technology, uses advanced
        speech recognition and language understanding models to determine when the business wants us to do something ​​–
        like select a number (“Press 1 for hours and locations”), say a word (“Say ‘representative’ to speak with one of
        our agents”) or input our account number. Assistant is able to recognize when hold music is being played and
        understands the difference between a recorded message (like “Hello, thank you for waiting”) and a representative
        on the line thanks to Duplex technology.
