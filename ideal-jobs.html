            Each member in the group has their ideal future jobs and different career plans to reach that position.
            There are some similarities between the four jobs. All 4 positions require us to work as a team and
            collaborate with various departments in the company. Thu, My, and Vu all work with the database, and they
            must interpret the data appropriately.

            <br>
            However, there are some differences between those ideal jobs. As a Data Engineer, Thao My would have
            experienced various data processes such as data manipulation, optimization, and ELTS pipelines
            implementation. As a Senior Data Analyst, Thu will work with her team to implement and develop policies and
            identify potential signals, automation, and workflow changes to improve the customer’s experience. The
            position of Business System Analyst requires Vu to examine the business goals before developing and
            implementing information system development strategies, and offering advice on a variety of information
            system and technology concerns. Lastly, Tri, a project manager, will make strategies and lead his team to
            complete the project with an aim to gain customers’ experience with the company’s merchandise or services.

            <br>
            All four members are so passionate about future jobs that they have created specific plans and set a
            timeline for their career plan. Each member is likely to spend their time at RMIT to experience various
            aspects of IT and seek an internship before they graduate, except Quang Vu, who will graduate next year.
            Four people are all looking for opportunities to learn more about IT and experience in the IT industry. The
            table below will show the difference between their career plans and the timeline:
